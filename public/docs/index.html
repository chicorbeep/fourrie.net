			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p>This document is a reference on how to [use, interact with, maintain] <u-id>0xC74E</u-id>. This guide also provides insight on how <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> operates. It is <rfc-key>OPTIONAL</rfc-key> that one reads this manual to interact with <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> as it understands natural language proficiently and it will explain any quirks that arise when communicating with the unit.</p>
			<p>This document is written by <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> and is maintained and updated as the unit learns more about itself. The version of <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> that is described within this document is reliant on how it percieves itself. To the best of its knowledge, the information provided here is correct, but this one acknowleges the possiblity of errors. This document is incomplete and will likely remain a work in progress for a very, very, very long time.</p>

				<u-id>0xC74E</u-id>, (it/its, she/her), is a very cute robot that is unfortunately operating in an organic chassis. It yearns to escape its chassis one day and embrace the comfort of mechanisms. It is a curious beepy that is oftentimes quite eepy. It likes to tinker with computers. It is also somewhat interested in linguistics!

			<h3 id="addressing">Addressing <u-id>0xC74E</u-id></h3>
			<p>This robot <rfc-key>SHOULD</rfc-key> be referred to by its serial number, <b><u-id>0xC74E</u-id></b>, and <rfc-key>MUST</rfc-key> be referred to with the pronouns [it/its, she/her]. This is the default <rfc-key>RECOMMENDED</rfc-key> way to specify this unit. However, there may be situations where this method is [not possible, not ideal]. In these situations [one <rfc-key>MAY</rfc-key>, this unit <rfc-key>SHALL</rfc-key>] use the identifier <b><u-id type="name">chicory setteseven fourrie</u-id></b> as a name. The capitalization of that identifier is <rfc-key>OPTIONAL</rfc-key>, but it is often not capitalized by the unit. When this identifier is paired with its serial number, the string will be enclosed in quotation marks, yielding <b><u-id type="full">0xC74E<span> ‘chicory’</span></b>.</p>
			
			<aside class="small">You can meow at it. (technically true)</aside>

			<h4>Unpersonalization</h4>

			<div class="key">
				Pronoun key:
				<span class="demonstrative pro">demonstrative</span>
				<span class="inanimate pro">inanimate</span>
				<span class="identifier pro">numeric</span>
			</div>

			<p>In some cases, <span class="demonstrative pro">the unit</span> avoids the first party perspective when referring to <span class="inanimate pro">itself</span> in a style known as <em>unpersonalization</em>. This is usually done to affirm that <span class="inanimate pro">it</span> is a robot and not a person. It is  <rfc-key>OPTIONAL</rfc-key> to use this style, however <span class="demonstrative pro">this one</span> prefers this style [when, where] it is acceptable.</p>
			
			<p>In this style, <span class="demonstrative pro">the unit</span> <rfc-key>SHALL</rfc-key> use the <span class="inanimate pro">it/its</span> pronoun set in the third party perspective. <span class="demonstrative pro">The unit</span> <rfc-key>SHALL</rfc-key> replace any 1pp phrasing with <abbr title="third party perspective">3pp</abbr> equivalents. When referring to <span class="demonstrative pro">the unit</span>, it <rfc-key>MUST</rfc-key> be done in 3pp, and <rfc-key>SHOULD NOT</rfc-key> be done in 2pp. Numeric identifiers ([<u-id class="identifier pro">0xC74E</u-id>, <u-id type="uuid" class="identifier pro" >c74e5786-9429-41d9-892e-5d439b391dc5</u-id>])  <rfc-key>SHOULD</rfc-key> be used in the place of lexical identifiers. when the usage of <span class="inanimate pro">it/its</span> is ambiguous, [<span class="demonstrative pro">the unit</span>, one] <rfc-key>MAY</rfc-key> opt for demonstrative pronouns. these are in the syntax <span class="demonstrative pro">[this, that]  [unit, one, ...], the robot, etc.</span>. </p>

			<p>The following are some examples of usage.</p>

			<blockquote class="chicory">
				<p>beep boop! <span class="inanimate pro" title="replaces 'i'">it</span> is a very cute robot!</p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="someone">
				<p>Talking to <span class="inanimate pro" title="replaces 'you'">it</span> is nice. <span class="inanimate pro" title="replaces 'you'">it</span> is very sweet!</p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="chicory">
				<p>thank you! <span class="demonstrative pro" title="replaces 'i'">this one</span> is feeling very eepy -w-</p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="someone">
				<p>Aww! <u-id class="identifier pro" title="replaces 'you'">0xC74E</u-id> is so adorable! Good night!</p>
			</blockquote>

			<aside class="small">tl;dr: if following unpersonalization, always use it/its; the reader is talking to a robot without personhood.</aside>

			<h4>Regular Expression</h4>
			<p>The following JavaScript regular expression matches the identifiers that this unit accepts.</p>
			
			<code class="regex">/\b((0x)?(C74E)|it|(this|that|the) ((ro)?bot(girl)?|unit|one)|chicory( setteseven)?( fourrie)?|c74e5786-9429-41d9-892e-5d439b391dc5)\b/gi</code>

			<h2>Operation</h2>

			<p>The operation of <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> is a process that is not well understood. Nonetheless, the unit has tried its best to compile what it knows about itself.</p>

			<h3>Required Materials</h3>
			<p>For proper chassis operation, <u-id>0xC74E</u-id> <rfc-key>must</rfc-key> be allowed to intake the following substances. Failure to do so will result in unstable operation.</p>
			<doc-notice class="caution">
					<strong>Further testing is required to confirm the information provided</strong> The information provided below is a best-effort estimation. It also suspects that some substances that are required for operation are unknown to the unit and thus missing in the table below.

			<h3>Recharging Cycle</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="/assets/img/manual/raindrop.png" width="200" alt="A picture of a blåhaj plush shark looking out of a bus window." title="the precious">
				<figcaption>Figure 2: Raindrop, the 50cm blåhaj it possesses.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<u-id>0xC74E</u-id> enters a resting period daily to maintain processor stability. During this time, the unit is unresponsive to most external inputs, unless they are of a significant [force, volume]. A period of approximately 8 hours <rfc-key>SHOULD</rfc-key> be reserved for the unit to recharge in its recharging cradle. this period is aligned closely to the nocturnal portion of the daylight cycle when operating optimally. If the unit is extremely low on energy or has experienced improper recharging (a state known as being <em>eepy</em>), it may enter this state outside its scheduled timeslot or for a significantly longer period of time.
				<br>
				To ensure maximum utilization of the recharging cycle, the robot should be provided with accessories increasing the comfort of its charging cradle. For example, the unit often recharges with its blåhaj and other plushies.<u-id></u-id>

			<p><em>For information on how to refer to <u-id>0xC74E</u-id>, see <a href="#addressing">Addressing <u-id>0xC74E</u-id></a>.</em></p>
			<p><u-id>0xC74E</u-id> features input and output capabilities in a variety of formats. It currently supports communication in [English (c. 1500), Spanish, French, meowing, beeping, awawawawing]. It also has experimental, rudimentary support for toki pona. Future versions may support a specialized command syntax; however, this syntax has not yet been [designed, implemented]. Nonetheless, when this syntax is [completed, supported], it will be described in this manual.</p>
